/**
 * @brief Agent represents a node in the memetic Population tree and links parent and children Agents
 *
 * The root Agent (agent 0) is the agent at depth 0 that contains no parent pointer. The root agents number of children
 * are defined by Agent<U>::DEGREE and the chain is terminated at Agent<U>::MAX_DEPTH where the children will be a
 * nullptr.
 * 
 * Each agent will contain a 'pocket' as the best solution for the agent and a 'current' which is solution being modified
 * by the MA and replaces the pocket when it betters the pocket in terms of fitness. These are stored within the members
 * attribute and are of template U type that are derived classes from Model<T> and override the mutation,
 * recombination, evalutation, show, etc. functions such that new types are introduced without modification to the core 
 * memetic algorithm.
 * 
 * The Agent class takes on responsibility of swapping pocket and current solutions and bubbling child solutions of the current Agent
 * with the parent solution. Other tree behaviors are regulated by the Population class, including the recusive bubbling process that
 * spans the entire tree and not just an individual Agent and its children.
 * 
 * The static members Agent<U>::OBJECTIVE and Agent<U>::LOCAL_SEARCH hold the functions that the tree uses to evaluate the class U Models
 * i.e. they take in a U* and a DataSet* to perform these functions
 *
