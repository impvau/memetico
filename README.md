[wuxishy](https://github.com/wuxishy)
- Initial implementation of [CFR](https://github.com/wuxishy/continued-fraction-regression) that was significantly extended by MohammadNHaque and later in conjunction with dr-hobot. Some of the class separation was inspired by this work

[MohammadNHaque](https://github.com/MohammadNHaque)
- Much work on [predicessor](https://github.com/university-of-newcastle-research/ContinuedFractionRegression-V2.5-R0223) of which some components were directly incorporated, such as the modified nelder mead
